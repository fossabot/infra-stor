- VM did not spin up correctly
- Cannot Rename VMs in YML
- Turns out I missed the Running status
- Cant switch from alpine to centos
- Cant give ignite gitop "." for local testing
- Need to work out local testing workflow
- Got into a bad state where ignite ps would show killed VMs and stop would say they weren't running
- Somehow got two VMs to have the same running state IPs
